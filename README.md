*Scheme of the delineation quality assessment (QA) process for an OAR. The analyze slice and edit slice rectangles have an associated time cost. The workflow variations we implement differ in the implementation of the go to next slice and analyze slice steps, which have a thicker border.*

## Setup
1. Install a conda (we recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/))
2. Create environment: `conda create --name=deds python=3.8`
3. Activate environment: `conda activate deds`
4. Install dependencies with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Replicating the paper results
1. Results in the `results_data` directory were generated by running the `study.py` script. This script runs the simulation using as input the patients' image volumes.
2. To recreate the table and the figure use in the analysis in the paper, run `python analysis.py`
